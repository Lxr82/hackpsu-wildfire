# hackpsu-wildfire
This program is a basic fire spread model based on the cellular automata model. 

To run the program, type:
```console
$python fire-simulator.py
```

Trees are represented by green squares, empty space by the brown, and fire by the orange. You can use the "Add Trees" and "Erase Trees" buttons to toggle drawing/deleting trees. Press "All Trees" if you want to fill the entire canvas, and "Clear All" to delete all the objects. (Prolonged use without clearing will cause lag!)

The lighter button allows you to draw fire patterns on the canvas. Press "Start" to start the fire simulation.
